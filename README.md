# yfinance bulk data download

In this project I have downloaded data using yfinance library. The code shows how to download technical and fundamental data points of recent years from the library which is also free of cost. I have tried several models to download bulk data and came to this final combination of downloading data which maintains data quality. In bulk data download like all stocks of Nifty500 or SnP500, data modeling becomes an issue while downloading data because of the range of columns. If there is any better approach, which is less confusing and user friendly, please hit me up with it. The downloaded data can be used for several projects in data analysis. yfinance also give intraday datapoints at minute frequency which can be helpful in making zero cost algo setups and testing. While kaggle also provide historical minute data points for major indexes free of cost, either could be used for testing algorithms.

I have also single added WMT dataset just for reference.
